# Constructor Functions vs. Factory Functions

## 1. Constructor Functions

- Naming: Constructor functions typically have names that start with an uppercase letter, such as `Person`, `Car`, `Product`, etc. This naming convention indicates that the function is meant to be used with the new keyword.

## 2. Factory Functions

- Naming: Factory functions, which create objects without using the `new` keyword, typically have names that start with a lowercase letter, such as `createPerson`, `createCar`, `createProduct`, etc. They do not require the new keyword and usually return the object directly.
