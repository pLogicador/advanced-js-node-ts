# Lexical Scope

### Lexical scope refers to the ability of a function in JavaScript to access variables from the location where it was declared, as well as from its surrounding scopes.

### This means that if a variable is not declared within the function, it will look up in the enclosing scope, moving upwards until it reaches the global scope if necessary.
