# Classic For Loop - Repetition Structure

> The classic for loop in JavaScript is one of the most commonly used structures for iterating over elements of a collection or
> performing a set number of operations. The loop continues as long as the specified condition evaluates to true.

- `Control Variable (i)`: The index (`i`) is declared once and used throughout the loop. In each iteration, the condition is checked, and if true, the loop continues.

- `Stopping Condition`: The loop runs until the stopping condition becomes false. Typically, this condition involves the index (`i`) reaching a certain limit.

- `Increment`/`Decrement`: The third part of the `for` statement defines how the index is modified in each iteration. The index can be incremented or decremented as needed, and you can even skip values.
