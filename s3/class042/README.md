# Definitions:

## Landscape:

> When the width is greater than the height. This is commonly associated with images and screens that are wider than they are tall, providing a wider view horizontally.

## Portrait:

> When the height is greater than the width. This is associated with images and screens that are taller than they are wide, providing a more elongated view vertically.

## Square:

> When the width is equal to the height. In this case, the image does not lean towards either the landscape or portrait orientation. It is a shape that can be considered neutral, as it does not have a predominance of width or height.
