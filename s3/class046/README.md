# `setInterval` and `setTimeout`

> These two functions are commonly used to manage time and delay the execution of code, available in both the browser and Node.js environments.

1. **`setInterval()`**:

- Repeatedly executes a function at specified time intervals.
- The code within the function will run continuously until it is stopped using `clearInterval()`.
- The first argument is the function to be executed, and the second argument is the time interval in milliseconds between each execution.
- Example: `setInterval(displayTime, 1000);` runs the `displayTime()` function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

2. **`setTimeout()`**:

   - Executes a function once after a specified delay.
   - It is used to delay the execution of a function by a certain amount of time.
   - Similar to setInterval, the first argument is the function to be executed, and the second argument is the delay before execution.
   - Example: `setTimeout(displayTime, 3000);` will execute the `displayTime()` function once after 3 seconds.

### **Comparison**:

- **`setInterval()`**: Ideal for repetitive tasks that should occur at regular intervals (e.g., updating the time, animations).
- **`setTimeout()`**: Used to delay the execution of a code block once after the defined time.

## Usage in Node.js and Browsers:

- Both `setInterval` and `setTimeout` are available in browser and Node.js environments. In the browser, they are commonly used for updating the user interface at regular intervals or delaying actions, while in Node.js, they are often used for asynchronous programming and timers.
