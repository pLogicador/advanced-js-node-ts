# Explanation

## `finally`:

> This block is executed after the `try` and `catch` blocks, regardless of whether an error occurred. It is ideal for actions
> that need to be performed regardless of success or failure of the previous code, such as releasing resources, closing files,
> or performing cleanup.

1. **Outer `try` Block**: The code within this block is executed first. If an error occurs here, execution is halted and control is transferred to the outer `catch` block.

2. **Outer `catch` Block**: If an error occurs in the outer `try` block, it is caught and handled here. If no error occurs, this block is skipped.

3. **Outer `finally` Block**: This block is always executed, regardless of whether an error occurred or not in the outer `try` block. It is useful for ensuring that cleanup code is always run.

4. **Inner `try` Block**: This block is nested inside the outer `try` block and can handle specific errors. If an error occurs here, it is caught by the inner `catch` block.

5. **Inner `catch` Block**: Catches and handles errors that occur in the inner `try` block.

6. **Inner `finally` Block**: Always executed after the inner `try` and `catch` blocks, regardless of whether an error occurred.
